## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Notification system** — bell icon in header; surface new form submissions, PO receipts, order status changes, payments requiring action
2. **PDF invoices** — most operationally critical; staff need to hand invoices to customers
3. **Run data migration** — export Customer Master CSV, run `migrate-customers.ts`
4. **Staff management** — settings page is a stub; need staff list + create/deactivate

## Known Issues / Tech Debt

| Issue | Priority | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Settings page is a stub | Medium | Placeholder only |
| `addPayment` action updates only `*Customer` fields, not `*Real` | Medium | Should update both when not dual invoice |
| No input validation on order wizard line item prices | Low | Easy to enter bad data |
| No pagination on customer/order/inventory lists | Low | Fine until data grows |
| Migration scripts not tested with real data | High | Need to test before running on prod |
| `committedQty` / `onOrderQty` on InventoryItem not auto-synced on order state changes | Medium | Currently manual or batch process |
